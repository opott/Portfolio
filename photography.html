      Photography is one of my favourite ways to express creativity and capture
      the beauty of the world around me. From landscapes to cityscapes, I enjoy
      exploring different perspectives and telling stories through my lens.
    </p>
    <h1>What I Like to Photograph</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Architechture - </strong>I'm fascinated by the shapes, patterns,
      and symmetry of buildings. From historic structures to modern skyscrapers,
      I enjoy capturing the details and prespectives that make architechture so
      unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nature - </strong>Exploring the outdoors is a big part of my
      photography. Whether it's landscapes, wildlife, or serene natural
      settings, I love finding ways to show the beauty of the natural world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Railways - </strong>Railways are a perfect blend of engineering
      and storytelling. I enhoy photographing trains, stations, and tracks,
      capturing their movement, design, and the role they play in connecting
      people and places.
    </p>
    <h1>Why I Enjoy Photography</h1>
    <p>
      For me, photography is about more than just taking pictures - it's a way
      to slow down, notice the details, and share my perspective with others.
      Every photo tells a story!
    </p>
    <h1>My Equipment</h1>
    <p>
      I shoot with a Canon EOS 2000D, and use a combination of Picasa 3 and
      Affinity Photo 2 to organise and edit my photos.
