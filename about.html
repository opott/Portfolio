        Hello! I'm Oliver, a passionate computer science and photography student
        who loves coding and capturing the beauty of the world through a camera.
        Based in the UK, I enjoy building cool projects and exploring my
        interests in technology, photography, and trains.
      </p>
      <h1>What I Do</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Programming - </strong>I am constantly learning and building.
        Whether it's developing websites, contributing to open-source, or
        experimenting with hardware like the Raspberry Pi, I enjoy bringing
        ideas to life. I also run <strong>CourseNotes</strong>, an educational
        revision website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Photography - </strong>When I'm not coding, you'll likely find
        me behind a camera, capturing stunning landscapes and architecture
        through my lens. Photography is my way of seeing and sharing the world's
        beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Railway - </strong> I have a keen interest in trains and enjoy
        riding them as well as watching videos about their operations and
        history.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cybersecurity - </strong>I'm deeply intrigued by the world of
        cybersecurity and aspire to pursue a career in this field. Protecting
        digital systems and solving security challenges fuels my passion for
        computing and digital innovation.
      </p>
      <h1>Passions</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Hack Club - </strong>I'm a proud member of
        <strong>Hack Club</strong>, a global community of high school students
        passionate about coding and creativity. Hack Club empowers students to
        build projects, learn together, and create a culture of innovation
        through collaboration and community events. At my school, I run a Hack
        Club, where I encourage fellow students to explore coding, build
        exciting projects and share their work with others. From hands-on
        workshops to creative problem-solving, my goal is to inspire a love for
        technology in others.
