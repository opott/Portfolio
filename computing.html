      <p>
        Computing is one of my greatest passions. I'm constantly learning,
        building, and experimenting with technology to expand my skills and
        explore new possibilities. Here's a look at some of my main interests:
      </p>
      <h1>Python</h1>
      <p>
        Python is my go to programming language. Its simplicity and versatility
        make it perfect for everything from automating tasks to creating
        powerful tools.
      </p>
      <h1>Web Development</h1>
      <p>
        I love using HTML to build websites and create the foundation for web
        projects. Paired with CSS and JavaScript, I enjoy designing functional
        and visually appealing web pages, including this website!
      </p>
      <h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
      <p>
        I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity, and
        want to learn more about the industry. It is of critical importance in
        the modern world, and I would love to be a part of protecting our
        digital world.
      </p>
      <h1>Raspberry Pi</h1>
      <p>
        The Raspberry Pi is a perfect combination of hardware and software for
        me. I enjoy experimenting with Linux and Docker, and hope to create a
        home server one day.
      </p>
      <h1>VoIP</h1>
      <p>
        VoIP is another area of computing that I'm interested in. I've explored
        how internet-based phone systems work and how to set them up using
        FreePBX on a Raspberry Pi.
      </p>
      <h1>Why Computing Excites Me</h1>
      <p>
        Computing allows me to combine creativity and problem-soliving in ways
        that are both practical and fun. Every project teaches me something new,
        and I enjoy this.
